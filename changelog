TODO:
- Modulated config loader (mechanics tell config what to load(?))
- Create an event handler, check for blockType and listening mechanics
- Create a decent blockMapper, not like the previous one with OVER 9000 functions
- Implement all the mechanics:
    * Gate
    * Bridge
    * Door
    * (Tele)Lift
    * Ammeter
    * Pen
    * Cauldron
    * Cycler (for chests, until notch fixed dem bugs)
    * Hidden Switch
    * PoweredBlock (changes blocks (materialtype) when powerd with redstone)
- Reorganize inventory code

Changed:
- Made interfaces for Mechanics. If they are registered, they will be executed by an ID (Sign ID), or by BlockType/EventType.
  This means that making new Mechanics is easier than before.
