Changelog:
- Made interfaces for Mechanics. If they are registered, they will be executed by an ID (Sign ID), or by BlockType/EventType.
  This means that making new Mechanics is easier than before.
- Implemented Pen
- Rewritten BlockBags, now it is possible to use Black Holes and Block Source as BlockBags, as well as chests
- Cauldron now accepts data-values as arguments in the config
